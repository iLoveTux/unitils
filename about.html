          <h2>What</h2><hr class="dark-hr" />
          <p>These are simplified clones of some common *nix utilities with 
          both a Python API and a CLI.</p>
          <p>With this approach we create fast, efficient and native utilities
          to use from within Python without needing to shell out or parse
          the output.</p>

        <div class="col-lg-4">
          <h2>How</h2><hr class="dark-hr" />
          <p>This project follows a simple architecture. Python iterators are
          created which accept the same parameters as some very useful utilities.
          We then use Python's argparse module to wrap a CLI onto this iterator
          at which point we also tailor the output from native Python types to
          familiar console output.</p>
          <p>We had also considered wraping a REST API or Web GUI around these
          things, but we feel that they would be better served as building blocks
          for many different types of Web Apps/APIs.</p>

            <h2>Rationale</h2><hr class="dark-hr" />
            <p>This project started with a small group of co-workers deciding
            that they needed something to help them day-to-day. We all loved
            shell scripts because they are concise and powerful. Readability
            of shell scripts, however, erodes over time.</p>
            <p>We decided that since the utilities had stood the test of 
            time due to their dynamic, well-planned nature were not in 
            need of a re-design, but rather they only lacked in their
            portability.</p>
            <p>By using Python, we were not only able to run our utilities
            on many different platforms. We were able to use our utilities
            right from within Python. In this way we were able to achieve
            more concise Python code natively, without shelling out.</p>
            <p>At the beginning, we had built a number of utilities, but had
            not packaged them nor had we bothered with unittests, Continuous
            Integration or comprehensive documentation. This project is my
            attempt to fix that.</p>
